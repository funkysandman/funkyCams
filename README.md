This is a collection of vb/c# .net programs that I use to control various machine vision type cameras.

These cameras are primarily used outdoors for taking snapshots of the night sky.

I've implemented a tensorflow object detection model to detect meteors.  The meteor detection program runs as a web service and analyzes pictures coming in from the cameras.

Also, I've written some simple ASCOM drivers to connect a few of the cameras to astrophotography imaging software. 

to do:
<li>clean up projects
<li>rename suitably
<li>document tensorflow machine learning project
